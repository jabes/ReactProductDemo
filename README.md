# BBYC - MVC ASSESMENT

The purpose of this exercise is to get an idea of your ability to implement design patterns where
appropriate, with regards to a high-traffic website. In particular we are looking for an object-oriented
approach comprised of extensible, decoupled, and tested modules/components.

The objective is to create a single page web app containing the following:

* Product listings as the main focus (retrieved from Best Buy Canada's REST API)
* Single level category listing side bar
* Modal window for displaying more detailed product information
* Unit tests and functional tests
